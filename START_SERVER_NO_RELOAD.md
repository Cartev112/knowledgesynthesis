# Start Server WITHOUT Auto-Reload

## The Problem

The `--reload` flag causes the server to restart whenever code changes are detected.

**This kills any in-progress OpenAI requests!**

Your logs show:
```
2025-10-09 14:58:57,724 - Calling OpenAI model: gpt-4o-mini (NO TIMEOUT)
WARNING: WatchFiles detected changes in 'app\main.py'. Reloading...
```

The server reloaded and killed your extraction!

---

## Solution 1: Start Without Reload (Recommended for Extraction)

**Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C)

**Start WITHOUT --reload:**
```bash
cd backendAndUI/python_worker
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

**Benefits:**
- Server won't restart during extraction
- Long-running OpenAI calls complete successfully
- Stable for production use

**Downside:**
- Need to manually restart to pick up code changes

---

## Solution 2: Don't Save Files During Extraction

If you want to keep `--reload`:

1. Start extraction
2. **Don't save any Python files** until extraction completes
3. Wait for log: `OpenAI API call completed successfully`
4. Then you can save files

---

## Solution 3: Use Both Approaches

**For extraction/testing:**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

**For development:**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## What to Look For in Logs

**Successful extraction will show:**
```

(No "completed successfully" message)

## Current Status

✅ **Logging is working!** You can now see:
- Request timestamps
- OpenAI extraction progress
- Errors and warnings
- Request duration

✅ **All fixes are in place:**
- No timeouts
- Significance fields preserved
- Better error handling

❌ **Server reloading is killing your extractions**

**Just restart WITHOUT --reload and try again!**
