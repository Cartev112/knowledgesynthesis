### Step 4: View Knowledge Graph (Viewing Tab)

Click the **"üîç Viewing"** tab to explore your knowledge graph.

#### View Options Panel (Top Left)

**Select Documents:**
1. Multi-select documents from dropdown (Ctrl+Click)
2. Click **"Load Graph"**
3. Graph displays combined knowledge

**Search Concepts:**

  - Number of source documents

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Green thick edges**: Verified by expert
- **Gray normal edges**: Unverified (needs review)
- **Red dashed edges**: Flagged as incorrect

### Step 5: Review Extractions (Review Queue Tab)

Click **"‚úÖ Review Queue"** tab (opens in new window):
