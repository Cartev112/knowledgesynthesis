TODO.MD

Small things:

Relationship/Node/Document Modals are not properly centered in the middle screen; they're also too big.

Document modal has horizontal/vertical scrollbars, which means something is too big. Create some kind of pagination for relationships + nodes so there's no need for scrolling. Also investigate uploaded metadata. All docs currently say Uploaded by: Unknown. Shouldn't say that.

Tooltip "Read More" button is not working.

Very subtle flicker of all nodes whenever the viewer is zoomed in/out. Fix this.

Review UI doesn't match @review-ui.py. Filtering doesn't work. Buttons do not work like review.py did.

Refactor/redevelop/Enhance Index Panel filtering. Add dropdown arrow for nodes/relationships. Add search bar for nodes/relationships. Add pagination for nodes/relationships. Also filtering by node type. 

Ensure viewer visual effects match the described visual language @visual-language.md

Line up all FABs on the left bottom half of the screen. Make them a bit smaller. 

Main header + tabs are just slightly too big.
