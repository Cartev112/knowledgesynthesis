BUGS


- ingestion container looks much smaller on someone elses computer

- Changes to workspace:
  Workspace page should be a tab on the main page
  Documents are not ingested INSIDE a workspace; they are ingested into the DB and then added to a workspace
  Allow users to add/remove existing documents/entities/relationships in the DB to a particular workspace

- Documents tab should show (public + user private) documents in the DB; if a document is being ingested for the second time, system recognizes it via ID/metadata, no duplication
