TODO.MD

Small things:

Relationship/Node/Document Modals are not properly centered in the middle screen; they're also too big.

Document modal has horizontal/vertical scrollbars, which means something is too big. Create some kind of pagination for relationships + nodes so there's no need for scrolling. Also investigate uploaded metadata. All docs currently say Uploaded by: Unknown. Shouldn't say that.



Review UI doesn't match @review-ui.py. Filtering doesn't work. Buttons do not work like review.py did.

Refactor/redevelop/Enhance Index Panel filtering. Add dropdown arrow for nodes/relationships. Add search bar for nodes/relationships. Add pagination for nodes/relationships. Also filtering by node type.
