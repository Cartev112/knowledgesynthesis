## Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Unified Graph & Validation âœ…

#### Test 1.1: Document Ingestion
- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/viewer`
- [ ] Upload a PDF file using the file input
- [ ] Click "Ingest PDF" and wait for processing
- [ ] Verify graph appears with nodes and relationships
- [ ] Check that all relationships have `status: unverified` (gray edges)

#### Test 1.2: Duplicate Prevention
- [ ] Upload the same PDF again
- [ ] Verify no duplicate nodes are created
- [ ] Check that existing relationships have the document_id in their `sources` array
- [ ] Confirm node count doesn't double

#### Test 1.3: Validation
- [ ] Check server logs for any validation warnings
- [ ] Verify no invalid triplets crashed the ingestion
- [ ] Confirm all triplets have normalized predicates (lowercase, snake_case)

### Phase 2: User Experience âœ…

#### Test 2.1: Document Selection
- [ ] Upload 2-3 different PDFs
- [ ] Open document dropdown - verify all documents are listed
- [ ] Select multiple documents (Ctrl+Click)
- [ ] Click "Apply Selection"
- [ ] Verify combined graph from selected documents appears

#### Test 2.2: Concept Search
- [ ] Type a concept name in the search box (e.g., "cancer", "protein")
- [ ] Press Enter or click "Search"
- [ ] Verify graph shows the concept and its relationships
- [ ] Try with "Verified only" checkbox - should show empty or verified subset

#### Test 2.3: Graph Visualization
- [ ] Click on a node - verify neighborhood highlights
- [ ] Click on an edge - verify details panel shows relationship info
- [ ] Check that edge colors reflect status:
  - Gray = unverified
  - Green = verified (after review)
  - Red = incorrect (after flagging)

### Phase 3: Expert Review Workflow âœ…

#### Test 3.1: Review Queue
- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/review-ui`
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows statistics (Unverified, Verified, Incorrect counts)
- [ ] Verify review queue shows unverified relationships
- [ ] Check that original text context is displayed
- [ ] Verify source documents are listed

#### Test 3.2: Confirm Action
- [ ] Click "âœ“ Confirm" on a relationship
- [ ] Verify success message appears
- [ ] Check statistics update (Unverified decreases, Verified increases)
- [ ] Return to Graph Viewer - verify edge is now green

#### Test 3.3: Flag Action
- [ ] Click "âš  Flag as Incorrect" on a relationship
- [ ] Enter a reason in the prompt
- [ ] Verify relationship status updates
- [ ] Check statistics reflect the change
- [ ] Return to Graph Viewer - verify edge is now red and dashed

#### Test 3.4: Edit Action
- [ ] Click "âœŽ Edit" on a relationship
- [ ] Enter a new confidence score (e.g., 0.95)
- [ ] Verify update succeeds
- [ ] Check that relationship is marked as verified

### Phase 4: Advanced Features âœ…

#### Test 4.1: Cross-Document Search
- [ ] Ensure multiple documents are ingested
- [ ] Search for a concept that appears in multiple documents
- [ ] Verify results show relationships from all sources
- [ ] Check that clicking an edge shows multiple document IDs in sources

#### Test 4.2: Verified-Only Filter
- [ ] Review and verify some relationships
- [ ] In Graph Viewer, check "Verified only" checkbox
- [ ] Click "Apply Selection" or search
- [ ] Verify only green (verified) edges appear

#### Test 4.3: API Endpoints
- [ ] Test `GET /review/stats` - verify JSON with counts
- [ ] Test `GET /query/documents` - verify list of documents
- [ ] Test `GET /query/search/concept?name=test` - verify search results
- [ ] Test `GET /review/queue` - verify review queue data

## Performance Testing

### Scalability Tests
- [ ] Upload a large PDF (20+ pages)
  - Expected: 30-60 seconds processing time
  - Should extract 20-50 triplets
  - Graph should render smoothly

- [ ] Upload 10+ documents
  - Document dropdown should remain responsive
  - Graph filtering should work efficiently
  - Review queue should paginate properly

### Stress Tests
- [ ] Search for very common terms (e.g., "the", "and")
  - Should handle gracefully or return focused results
  - Should not crash or hang

- [ ] Review 50+ relationships in succession
  - UI should remain responsive
  - Statistics should update correctly
  - No memory leaks

## Security Checklist

- [ ] OpenAI API key is in `.env`, not hardcoded
- [ ] Neo4j credentials are in `.env`, not hardcoded
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No sensitive data in git repository
- [ ] CORS configured appropriately for production

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] README.md updated with current features
- [ ] QUICKSTART.md available for end users
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md available for developers
- [ ] API endpoints documented in FastAPI auto-docs
- [ ] Code comments added to complex logic

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations (As Designed)
1. **Edit Limitations**: Review edit endpoint doesn't support changing subject/predicate/object (only metadata)
   - Rationale: Changing these requires creating new relationships
   - Workaround: Flag as incorrect and re-extract

2. **User Authentication**: Framework in place but not fully integrated
   - `reviewer_id` parameter exists but not enforced
   - Future: Integrate with node-server authentication

3. **Extraction Parameters**: Max concepts/relationships not yet configurable via UI
   - Current: Hardcoded to ~50 triplets per document
   - Future: Add UI controls in Phase 2.1

### Expected Behaviors (Not Bugs)
- Empty review queue when all relationships reviewed: âœ… Working as intended
- Same relationship from multiple docs has multiple sources: âœ… Correct behavior
- Unverified relationships are gray: âœ… By design for quality control
- Search returns no results for non-existent concepts: âœ… Correct

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "No items in queue"
**Solution**: This is normal if all relationships have been reviewed. Change filter to "Verified" or "Flagged" to see reviewed items.

### Issue: Graph viewer shows no nodes
**Solution**: 
1. Check Neo4j is running
2. Verify documents are ingested (check `/query/documents`)
3. Try refreshing the document list
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: OpenAI extraction fails
**Solution**:
1. Verify API key in `.env`
2. Check OpenAI account has credits
3. Set `OPENAI_DRY_RUN=true` for testing without API

### Issue: Slow graph rendering
**Solution**:
1. Filter to fewer documents
2. Use "Verified only" to reduce edge count
3. Use search to focus on specific concepts
4. Consider Neo4j indexing for large datasets

## Production Deployment Notes

### For Production Use:
1. Set `OPENAI_DRY_RUN=false`
2. Configure production Neo4j instance
3. Set up proper authentication (Phase 4.2)
4. Configure logging to file (not just console)
5. Set up monitoring for API health
6. Consider rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
7. Implement backup strategy for Neo4j
8. Add SSL/TLS for production endpoints

### Recommended Infrastructure:
- **Neo4j**: 4GB+ RAM, SSD storage
- **Backend**: 2GB+ RAM, modern Python runtime
- **Network**: HTTPS for all endpoints
- **Backup**: Daily Neo4j database snapshots

## Success Criteria

The deployment is successful if:
- âœ… Documents can be uploaded and processed
- âœ… Knowledge graph is built and visualized
- âœ… Duplicate concepts are merged across documents
- âœ… Review queue loads with unverified relationships
- âœ… Experts can confirm/flag relationships
- âœ… Search finds concepts across all documents
- âœ… Verified-only filter works
- âœ… No critical errors in logs
- âœ… All API endpoints respond correctly

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **User Training**: Train domain experts on the review interface
2. **Content Pipeline**: Establish process for regular document uploads
3. **Quality Metrics**: Monitor verification rate and accuracy
4. **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback for UX improvements
5. **Scale Testing**: Test with production-scale document volumes
6. **Feature Requests**: Prioritize Phase 2.1 and 4.2 enhancements

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks:
- Weekly: Check review queue stats, ensure experts are active
- Monthly: Review flagged relationships for pattern analysis
- Quarterly: Optimize Neo4j database (cleanup, indexing)
- As needed: Update OpenAI model version, retune extraction prompt

### Monitoring Recommendations:
- API uptime and response times
- OpenAI API usage and costs
- Neo4j database size and query performance
- User activity (uploads, reviews)
- Error rates and validation warnings
