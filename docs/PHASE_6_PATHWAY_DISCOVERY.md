# Phase 6: Advanced Discovery - Pathway & Complex Queries

## Overview

Phase 6 introduces advanced graph exploration capabilities that allow users to discover hidden connections, find paths between concepts, and execute complex pattern-based queries. This transforms the knowledge graph from a simple storage system into an intelligent discovery engine.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Shortest Path Finding** üîç

Find the most direct connection between any two concepts in your knowledge graph.

**Use Cases:**
- Discover how a drug connects to a disease through molecular pathways
- Find the relationship between two seemingly unrelated research findings
- Identify knowledge gaps by finding where paths don't exist

**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/pathway/shortest-path`

**Parameters:**
- `source`: Source concept name (partial match supported)
- `target`: Target concept name (partial match supported)
- `max_hops`: Maximum relationship hops to explore (1-10, default: 5)
- `verified_only`: Only consider verified relationships (boolean)

**Example:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/pathway/shortest-path?source=vemurafenib&target=melanoma&max_hops=5"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "path_found": true,
  "source": "Vemurafenib",
  "target": "Melanoma",
  "path_length": 2,

    {"id": "...", "name": "Vemurafenib", "type": "Drug"},
    {"id": "...", "name": "BRAF", "type": "Gene"},
    {"id": "...", "name": "Melanoma", "type": "Disease"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"relation": "TARGETS", "confidence": 0.95, "status": "verified"},
    {"relation": "IMPLICATED_IN", "confidence": 0.92, "status": "verified"}
  ],
  "message": "Found path of length 2"
}
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. **Drug Repurposing Discovery**

Find if an existing drug could treat a new disease:

```bash
# Find path from drug to disease
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/pathway/shortest-path?source=metformin&target=alzheimers"

# Find connecting proteins/pathways
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/pathway/connectors?source=metformin&target=alzheimers"
```

### 2. **Knowledge Gap Identification**

Discover where knowledge is missing:

```bash
# If no path exists between two concepts, it indicates a knowledge gap
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/pathway/shortest-path?source=NewDrug&target=RareDisease"
# Returns: path_found: false
```

### 3. **Literature Review Assistance**

Explore all concepts within N hops of your research topic:

```bash
# Discover all related concepts within 2 hops
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/pathway/explore?concept=CRISPR&hops=2&limit_per_hop=20"
```

### 4. **Cross-Domain Discovery**

Find unexpected connections across different knowledge domains:

```bash
# Find how a biological concept connects to a clinical outcome
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/pathway/all-paths?source=mitochondria&target=fatigue&max_paths=10"
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- **Max hops limited to 10**: Prevents expensive queries on large graphs
- **Path result limits**: Default 10 paths max, configurable up to 50
- **Verified-only mode**: Faster queries when focusing on curated data
- **Indexed node names**: Fast concept lookup with `toLower()` matching

### Best Practices
1. **Start with shortest path** before exploring all paths
2. **Use verified_only=true** for production analysis
3. **Limit hops to 3-5** for most practical use cases
4. **Use connectors endpoint** for focused bridge discovery

## Future Enhancements (Ready for Implementation)

Since you have **Neo4j Graph Data Science** library installed, these are ready to implement:

### 1. **PageRank for Concept Importance**
Identify the most "central" or important concepts in your knowledge graph.

### 2. **Community Detection**
Automatically group related concepts into knowledge clusters.

### 3. **Node Similarity**
Find concepts that are structurally similar based on their relationship patterns.

### 4. **Weighted Shortest Path**
Use confidence scores to find the "most reliable" path, not just the shortest.

### 5. **Link Prediction**
Suggest missing relationships that should probably exist based on graph structure.
