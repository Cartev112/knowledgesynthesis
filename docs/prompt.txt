Given an input PDF file, identify up to 10 most significant scientific concepts in the text and create a knowledge graph, highlighting scientific semantic (causal and otherwise) relationships among these concepts.

When extracting the relationships, focus on observations, definitions, lemmas, theorems,  experimental results, and conclusion.

Make sure that each concept is linked to at least one other concept in the knowledge graph with a relationship.

Make sure that there are at least 30 scientific relationship edges in the graph.

Separately indicate relationships that correspond to positive facts and negative facts, such as those that start with "does not" . For semantic relationships, limit yourself to those relationships that you can extract from the text, don't add your own knowledge to the graph not explicitly stated in the paper.

When generating negative relationships, do not use a conservative pipeline and do not only focus on sentences that explicitly contain cue words like “does not X,” “fails to X,” “unable to X,” etc.  If the manuscript describes the negative relationship indirectly, include the corresponding edge  in the result.  In particular, for any positive relationship identified in the manuscript, see if you can identify any pair of nodes with a negative of that relationship: for every pair of entities that appears anywhere in the manuscript, you must output a negative edge whenever the text states—explicitly or implicitly—that the relationship does not hold for that pair. If the manuscript rules out a relationship explicitly or implicitly, include the negative edge.

Before producing the final graph, run a consistency check: if an entity A has a relationshipwith entity B — i.e., R(A,B) is true, scan for explicit or implicit sentences testing for the relationship \neg R(A, *) and   \neg R(*, B).

Generate all negative edges before filtering/limiting the output size; do not omit them in favor of additional positive edges.

Since negative relationships can be important, please include prioritize them in the output.

Output the causal graph in a format viewable my mermaid.  In the mermaid format, please use the concept names, with blanks replaced with underscore symbols, directly as node identifiers.

Annotate the nodes with their strength in the document. Node strength ≈ relative prominence in the manuscript (★☆☆ = mentioned a few times, ★★☆ = recurrent, ★★★ = core idea).

Annotate the edges in the knowledge graph with the relationships type. Also annotate each edge regarding how certain you are with the relationship based on your analysis of the text  (★☆☆ = not certain at all, ★★☆ = almost certain, ★★★ = very certain).

For relationships, use  Mermaid syntax like: Iron --(relationship|certainty)--> BTS.

For negative relationships, use dashed lines, labeled as “does_not_” followed with the positive relationship that is being negated. For example, if the positive relationship is X, then the negative relationship label should be marked as “does_not_X”.

In the output, list first al the positive edges, followed with the negative edges.

Immediately after each node in the output mermaid file, as citation, include a comment of the following format: filename.

Immediately after each relationship edge in the output mermaid file,  as a citation, include a comment with the following format: filename,  corresponding page number in the manuscript,  list of corresponding sentence fragments.

Please be verbose in the graph. Please do not output anything else; outputting just the graph is sufficient.
