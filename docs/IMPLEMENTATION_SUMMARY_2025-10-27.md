# Implementation Summary - October 27, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes implemented based on the October 27, 2025 meeting feedback. The focus was on making the Knowledge Synthesis platform domain-agnostic, user-centric, and more flexible for research workflows.

## Completed Implementations

### 1. Domain-Agnostic Extraction Prompt ✅

**Problem**: Extraction prompt was biased toward biomedical domains with hardcoded entity types (Drug, Gene, Protein, Disease, etc.).

**Solution**:
- Removed all domain-specific entity type examples from extraction prompt
- Changed to generic, context-appropriate type classification
- Updated prompt to use descriptive types based on function (Algorithm, Theory, Metric, Framework, Process, Entity, Property, Outcome)
- Made "Concept" the fallback type for uncertain classifications
- Updated dry-run examples to be domain-agnostic (Machine Learning, Deep Learning examples instead of biomedical)

**Files Modified**:
- `backendAndUI/python_worker/app/services/openai_extract.py`
  - `_create_prompt()` function (lines 14-52)
  - `_fake_extract()` function (lines 55-95)

**Impact**: Platform can now process papers from ANY scientific discipline without bias.

---

### 2. Natural Extraction Balance ✅

**Problem**: Prompt forced 50% negative relationships, creating artificial balance.

**Solution**:
- Removed the 50% negative relationship requirement
- Changed to "extract negative relationships when EXPLICITLY stated"
- Removed forced balance instructions
- Let extraction reflect natural distribution in text

**Files Modified**:
- `backendAndUI/python_worker/app/services/openai_extract.py`
  - `_create_prompt()` function (lines 33-38)

**Impact**: Extraction now reflects natural content distribution, avoiding forced or hallucinated negative relationships.

---

### 3. Consistent Terminology ✅

**Problem**: Mixing terms "entity", "subject", "object", and "concept" inconsistently.

**Solution**:
- Updated extraction prompt to use "concept" consistently
- Changed significance scores to reference "concept" not "entity"
- Updated dry-run examples to use domain-agnostic concepts
- Updated UI labels to say "concepts" instead of "nodes"

**Files Modified**:
- `backendAndUI/python_worker/app/services/openai_extract.py`
  - Prompt text updated throughout
- `node-server/public/index.html`
  - Context modal labels updated

**Impact**: Clear, consistent terminology across the platform.

---

### 4. Neutral Graph Context Prompt ✅

**Problem**: Graph context prompt assumed user wanted to find agreements, disagreements, and additions.

**Solution**:
- Made context prompt neutral - doesn't assume user intent
- Changed to: "Use this context to guide your extraction based on the user's stated goals"
- Removed prescriptive instructions about finding agreements/disagreements
- Let user specify their research intent explicitly

**Files Modified**:
- `backendAndUI/python_worker/app/services/openai_extract.py`
  - Lines 150-162: Updated context-aware extraction instructions

**Impact**: User has full control over extraction intent.

---

### 5. Comprehensive Context Configuration Modal ✅

**Problem**: Context selection only worked with manually selected individual nodes (Shift+Click), which was too granular and not intuitive.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive modal with flexible context selection:

#### Context Sources (Select Multiple):
1. **Selected Concepts** - Use Shift+Click selected nodes
2. **Selected Relationships** - Use selected edges (when implemented)
3. **Current Filtered View** - Use whatever is currently visible after filtering
4. **Specific Documents** - Select from list of all documents

#### Extraction Intent (User-Controlled):
- ☑ **Complement**: Find relationships that support/confirm existing knowledge
- ☑ **Conflict**: Find relationships that contradict existing knowledge
- ☑ **Extend**: Find new relationships that expand existing knowledge
- ☐ **Distinct**: Find relationships unrelated to existing knowledge

#### Features:
- Wide modal with clear sections
- Real-time context summary
- Preview functionality
- Apply/Clear/Cancel actions
- Persistent configuration
- Visual feedback on main UI

**Files Modified**:
- `node-server/public/index.html`
  - Added context configuration modal (lines 427-522)
  - Updated ingestion UI button (lines 87-101)
- `node-server/public/js/ingestion/ingestion.js`
  - Added `contextConfig` state object
  - Added `openContextConfig()` method
  - Added `closeContextConfig()` method
  - Added `loadDocumentsList()` method
  - Added `updateContextSummary()` method
  - Added `applyContextConfig()` method
  - Added `updateMainContextSummary()` method
  - Added `clearContext()` method
  - Added `buildIntentInstructions()` method
  - Updated `getGraphContextText()` to use new config
  - Updated `ingestDocument()` to use new config

**Impact**: 
- Users can select context in multiple flexible ways
- Users explicitly control extraction intent
- No assumptions about research goals
- More intuitive and discoverable

## Technical Details

### Context Configuration State Structure

```javascript
contextConfig = {
  enabled: false,
  sources: {
    selectedNodes: false,
    selectedEdges: false,
    filteredView: false,
    documents: false,
    documentIds: []
  },
  intents: {
    complements: true,
    conflicts: true,
    extends: true,
    distinct: false
  }
}
```

### Intent Instructions Generation

When context is enabled, the system generates intent-specific instructions:

```
EXTRACTION INTENT:
- COMPLEMENT: Find relationships that support, confirm, or align with the existing knowledge
- CONFLICT: Find relationships that contradict or disagree with the existing knowledge
- EXTEND: Find new relationships that add to or expand upon the existing knowledge
```

These instructions are prepended to the graph context text sent to OpenAI.

## Remaining Work (Phase 2-5)

### High Priority

1. **Edge/Relationship Selection in Graph Viewer**
   - Implement Shift+Click for edges
   - Store selected edges in `state.selectedEdges`
   - Update context modal to use selected edges

2. **Re-Extraction from Existing Documents**
   - Add existing document dropdown in ingestion
   - Detect duplicates by title/hash
   - Allow re-extraction with different parameters
   - Preserve document ID

3. **State Persistence Across Tabs**
   - Store selection state globally
   - Restore when switching tabs
   - Fix visual feedback consistency

### Medium Priority

4. **Relationship-Type Filtering**
   - Show relationship types (not just instances)
   - Add relationship type list with counts
   - Filter by relationship type
   - Make relationships first-class in UI

5. **UI Bug Fixes**
   - Fix document/entity count display
   - Improve selection visual feedback
   - Fix graph refresh after filtering

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Domain Agnostic**: Platform works for ANY scientific discipline
2. **User Agency**: Don't assume user intent - let them specify
3. **Flexibility**: Support multiple ways to select context
4. **Relationship Equality**: Relationships are as important as concepts
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Support re-extraction and elaboration (pending)
6. **Clear Communication**: Use consistent terminology throughout

## Communication Protocol Established

Before implementing significant changes:
1. Write a short proposal
2. Share with Dr. Kendal/Dr. Akbar
3. Get feedback before implementation
4. Avoid implementing then debugging

This prevents:
- Wasted implementation effort
- Domain-specific biases
- Misaligned features
- Terminology confusion
