# Workspace Implementation Status

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** Backend Complete - Frontend In Progress

---

## ✅ Completed - Backend

### 1. Data Models (`app/models/workspace.py`)

Created comprehensive Pydantic models:
- `Workspace` - Main workspace model with stats and members
- `WorkspacePermissions` - Granular permission system
- `WorkspaceMember` - Member information and role
- `WorkspaceStats` - Document/entity/relationship counts
- `CreateWorkspaceRequest` - Workspace creation payload
- `UpdateWorkspaceRequest` - Workspace update payload
- `InviteMemberRequest` - Member invitation payload
- `GraphFilter` - Filter model for graph queries

### 2. Workspace Service (`app/services/workspace_service.py`)

Implemented full CRUD operations:
- ✅ `create_workspace()` - Create new workspace with owner
- ✅ `get_workspace()` - Get workspace by ID with permission check
- ✅ `list_user_workspaces()` - List all user's workspaces
- ✅ `update_workspace()` - Update workspace properties
- ✅ `delete_workspace()` - Delete workspace (owner only)
- ✅ `archive_workspace()` - Archive workspace
- ✅ `invite_member()` - Invite user to workspace
- ✅ `remove_member()` - Remove member from workspace
- ✅ `_get_workspace_members()` - Helper to fetch members
- ✅ `_get_workspace_stats()` - Helper to calculate stats
- ✅ `_user_has_permission()` - Permission checking

### 3. API Routes (`app/routes/workspaces.py`)

RESTful API endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/workspaces` - List user's workspaces
- ✅ `POST /api/workspaces` - Create workspace
- ✅ `GET /api/workspaces/:id` - Get workspace details
- ✅ `PUT /api/workspaces/:id` - Update workspace
- ✅ `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id` - Delete workspace
- ✅ `POST /api/workspaces/:id/archive` - Archive workspace
- ✅ `POST /api/workspaces/:id/invite` - Invite member
- ✅ `DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/members/:userId` - Remove member

### 4. Database Integration

Updated Neo4j schema:
- ✅ `Workspace` nodes with properties
- ✅ `MEMBER_OF` relationships with roles and permissions
- ✅ `BELONGS_TO` relationships (Document → Workspace)
- ✅ Updated `graph_write.py` to associate documents with workspaces

### 5. Main App Integration

- ✅ Registered workspace router in `main.py`
- ✅ Workspace routes available at `/api/workspaces/*`

## 🚧 In Progress - Frontend

### Next Steps

1. **Workspace Landing Page**
   - Grid layout of workspace cards
   - Create new workspace button
   - Global view option
   - Recent activity feed

2. **Workspace Switcher Component**
   - Dropdown in top navigation
   - Quick workspace switching
   - Access to settings
   - Return to landing page

3. **View Filter Panel**
   - Right sidebar with filters
   - View mode selection (my content, workspace, collaborative, global)
   - User selection for collaborative view
   - Additional filters (entity types, dates, significance)

4. **Workspace Settings Modal**
   - General settings tab
   - Collaborators management tab
   - Extraction settings tab
   - Privacy settings tab

5. **Context Indicators**
   - Status bar showing current workspace and view mode
   - Node coloring by creator
   - User legend
   - Workspace badges in global view

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Workspace Node

```cypher
CREATE (w:Workspace {
  workspace_id: 'uuid',
  name: 'Immune Cell Engineering',
  description: 'Research on CAR-T cells...',
  icon: '🧬',
  color: '#3B82F6',
  privacy: 'private', // 'private', 'organization', 'public'
  created_by: 'user_id',
  created_at: datetime(),
  updated_at: datetime(),
  archived: false
})
```

### Relationships

```cypher
// User membership
(u:User)-[:MEMBER_OF {
  role: 'owner', // 'owner', 'editor', 'viewer'
  permissions: {
    view: true,
    add_documents: true,
    edit_relationships: true,
    invite_others: true,
    manage_workspace: true
  },
  joined_at: datetime()
}]->(w:Workspace)

// Document belongs to workspace
(d:Document)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(w:Workspace)

// Entities are in workspace (derived from documents)
(e:Entity)-[:IN_WORKSPACE]->(w:Workspace)
```

## 🔌 API Examples

### Create Workspace

```bash
POST /api/workspaces
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Immune Cell Engineering",
  "description": "Research on CAR-T cell engineering",
  "icon": "🧬",
  "color": "#3B82F6",
  "privacy": "private"
}
```

### List Workspaces

```bash
GET /api/workspaces?include_archived=false
```

### Invite Member

```bash
POST /api/workspaces/{workspace_id}/invite
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_email": "belinda@example.com",
  "role": "editor",
  "permissions": {
    "view": true,
    "add_documents": true,
    "edit_relationships": true,
    "invite_others": false,
    "manage_workspace": false
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Permission System

### Roles

| Role | View | Add Docs | Edit Rels | Invite | Manage |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Owner | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Viewer | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Permissions

- `view` - Can view workspace and its content
- `add_documents` - Can upload documents to workspace
- `edit_relationships` - Can modify/delete relationships
- `invite_others` - Can invite new members
- `manage_workspace` - Can update settings, archive, delete

## 📊 Current Status Summary

**Backend:** 95% Complete
- ✅ Models defined
- ✅ Service layer implemented
- ✅ API routes created
- ✅ Database integration done
- ⚠️ Auth system needs real implementation

**Frontend:** 0% Complete
- ⏳ Awaiting implementation
- 📋 Detailed spec available in `WORKSPACE_UI_SPECIFICATION.md`

**Integration:** 20% Complete
- ✅ Backend routes registered
- ✅ Document-workspace association added
- ⏳ Frontend integration pending
- ⏳ Worker updates pending

---

## 🚀 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement User Authentication**
   - Replace placeholder `get_current_user()` with real auth
   - Create User model
   - Add user registration/login

2. **Start Frontend Development**
   - Create workspace landing page
   - Build workspace switcher component
   - Implement basic filtering

3. **Test Backend APIs**
   - Use Postman/curl to test all endpoints
   - Verify permission system works
   - Test workspace creation and member management

4. **Update Worker**
   - Add workspace_id to job data
   - Pass workspace_id to graph_write
   - Test document ingestion with workspaces

---

## 📝 Notes

- Permission system is flexible and can be customized per member
- Workspaces support both private and shared collaboration
- Documents can belong to multiple workspaces (if needed in future)
- Archive feature allows soft-delete without data loss
- Stats are calculated dynamically (could be cached for performance)
