# Knowledge Extraction Improvement Brainstorming

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Extraction Method
The platform currently uses:
- **Manual Upload**: Users upload PDFs or paste text
- **Full Document Processing**: Entire document is sent to OpenAI GPT
- **Batch Extraction**: AI extracts all triplets in one pass
- **Context-Aware Mode**: Users can select existing graph nodes as context for targeted extraction

### Limitations of Current Approach
1. **Passive Ingestion**: Users must know which documents to upload
2. **No Discovery**: System doesn't help find relevant documents
3. **Manual Curation**: Users must locate and upload each document individually
4. **Limited Targeting**: Even with context-aware extraction, entire document is processed
5. **No Prioritization**: All content treated equally, regardless of relevance
6. **Scalability**: Processing full documents is token-intensive and slow

  - Citation network traversal

##### B. Local Document Repository Search
- **Vector Database for Uploaded Docs**
  - Store embeddings of all previously uploaded documents

- User specifies which sections to prioritize
- Extract only from selected sections

##### B. Relevance-Based Section Filtering
- Generate embeddings for each section
- Compare against user query or existing graph context
- Rank sections by relevance
- Extract only from top N sections

##### C. Progressive Extraction
- Start with Abstract and Conclusion (high-level findings)
- If relevant, proceed to Results
- If highly relevant, process Methods and Discussion
- Adaptive depth based on relevance scores

#### Benefits
- **Token Efficiency**: Process only relevant content
- **Faster Processing**: Smaller text chunks = faster extraction
- **Better Precision**: Focus on sections with key findings
- **Cost Reduction**: Fewer API calls to OpenAI

---

### 3. **Two-Stage Extraction Pipeline**

#### Concept
Separate relevance assessment from knowledge extraction.

#### Stage 1: Relevance Scoring
- Fast, cheap model (GPT-4o-mini or local model)
- Analyzes document/section
- Scores relevance to user query or graph context
- Decides: Extract fully, Extract partially, or Skip

#### Stage 2: Targeted Extraction
- Only process content that passed Stage 1
- Use more powerful model (GPT-4) for actual extraction
- Extract with full context and precision

#### Benefits
- **Cost Optimization**: Expensive model only for relevant content
- **Quality Control**: Pre-filtering reduces noise
- **Scalability**: Can process large document sets efficiently

##### B. Hypothesis-Driven Extraction
- User poses hypothesis: "Does Drug X interact with Protein Y?"
- System searches for papers mentioning both entities
- Extracts relationships specifically about this interaction
- Presents evidence for/against hypothesis

##### C. Citation Network Traversal
- Start with a seed paper
- Extract key entities
- Find papers that cite or are cited by seed paper
- Extract relationships involving those entities

- Link visual evidence to text-based triplets

##### B. Supplementary Material Processing
- Many papers have rich supplementary data
- Extract from supplementary tables, datasets
- Process supplementary figures and methods

#### Benefits
- **Richer Extraction**: Capture data often missed in text-only processing

### 6. **Collaborative Filtering & Recommendation**

#### Concept
Learn from user behavior to recommend relevant documents.

#### Implementation

##### A. User Interest Modeling
- Track which entities/relationships users verify
- Track which documents users upload
- Build user interest profile
- Recommend papers matching their research focus

- Split document into semantic chunks (paragraphs, sections)
- Process each chunk independently
- Stream results to graph as they're extracted
- User sees progress in real-time

##### B. Adaptive Stopping
- Monitor extraction quality/relevance per chunk
- If relevance drops below threshold, stop processing
- Saves tokens on less relevant documents

##### C. Background Processing Queue
- User submits multiple documents
- System processes in background
- Notifies when complete

- Extracts efficacy, side effects, mechanisms for both
- Presents comparative knowledge graph

#### Benefits
- **Direct Answers**: Extract exactly what user needs
- **Efficiency**: No need to process entire documents
- **Evidence-Based**: All answers linked to source text

---

### 10. **Entity-Centric Extraction**

#### Concept
Focus extraction on specific entities of interest.

#### Implementation

##### A. Entity Watchlist
- User creates watchlist: ["BRAF", "Vemurafenib", "Melanoma"]
- System only extracts relationships involving these entities
- Ignores unrelated content
- Builds deep knowledge about specific entities

##### B. Entity Expansion
- Start with seed entity
- Extract all relationships
- Add connected entities to watchlist
