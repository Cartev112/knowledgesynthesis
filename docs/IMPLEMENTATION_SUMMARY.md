# Knowledge Synthesis Application - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a comprehensive knowledge synthesis graph application with unified graph construction, expert review capabilities, and advanced cross-document querying.

## Completed Features

### ✅ Phase 1: Solidified Foundation - Unified Graph & Robust Ingestion

#### 1.1 Enhanced MERGE Logic with Status Tracking
- **File**: `backend/python_worker/app/services/graph_write.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `status` property to relationships (default: `'unverified'`)
  - Added `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
  - Status values: `'unverified'`, `'verified'`, `'incorrect'`
  - Preserves existing status when relationships are matched across documents

#### 1.2 Source Annotation
- **Already Implemented**: Source tracking via `sources` array on relationships
- Properly handles multi-document evidence using MERGE logic
- Documents linked via `EXTRACTED_FROM` relationships

#### 1.3 Robust Parser & Validator
- **File**: `backend/python_worker/app/services/validator.py` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - `normalize_predicate()`: Converts predicates to lowercase snake_case
  - `normalize_entity_name()`: Cleans entity names
  - `validate_triplet()`: Checks required fields, length constraints, confidence scores
  - `sanitize_triplet()`: Cleans and normalizes triplet data
  - `deduplicate_triplets()`: Removes duplicate extractions
- **Integration**: Automatically applied in `openai_extract.py` before Neo4j writes

### ✅ Phase 2: Core User Experience - The MVP

#### 2.1 Ingestion Endpoints
- **Existing Endpoints**:
  - `POST /ingest/run` - Ingest from hardcoded file
  - `POST /ingest/text` - Ingest from raw text with custom document_id
  - `POST /ingest/pdf` - Upload PDF (auto-generates SHA-256 document_id)

#### 2.2 Document-Specific Visualization
- **Endpoint**: `GET /query/graph_by_docs`
- **Parameters**:
  - `doc_ids`: Comma-separated document IDs
  - `verified_only`: Boolean filter for verified relationships only

  - Marks relationship as `'incorrect'`
  - Records optional `flag_reason`

- **GET /review/stats**
  - Returns counts of unverified/verified/incorrect relationships

## Data Model

### Neo4j Schema

#### Nodes
- **Entity**: Knowledge graph concepts
  - Properties: `name`, `type`
  - Example: `(:Entity {name: "BRAF", type: "Gene"})`

- **Document**: Source documents
  - Properties: `document_id`, `title`
  - Example: `(:Document {document_id: "sha256...", title: "paper.pdf"})`

#### Relationships
- **Dynamic Relationship Types**: Subject-Predicate-Object
  - Properties:
    - `sources`: Array of document IDs
    - `status`: `'unverified'|'verified'|'incorrect'`
    - `confidence`: Float (0.0-1.0)
    - `original_text`: Source sentence
    - `extracted_by`: Extractor identifier
    - `created_at`: Timestamp
    - `updated_at`: Timestamp
    - `reviewed_at`: Timestamp (if reviewed)
    - `reviewed_by`: Reviewer identifier
    - `flag_reason`: String (if flagged)
  - Example: `(drug)-[:INHIBITS {sources: ["doc1", "doc2"], status: "verified"}]->(protein)`

- **EXTRACTED_FROM**: Links entities to source documents
  - Example: `(entity)-[:EXTRACTED_FROM]->(document)`

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Unified Graph with MERGE
- Uses Neo4j `MERGE` to create-or-match nodes and relationships
- Prevents duplicate entities across documents
- Aggregates evidence via `sources` array

### 2. Status-Based Verification
- All extractions default to `'unverified'`
- Expert review promotes to `'verified'` or flags as `'incorrect'`
- Status preserved when relationships re-extracted from new documents

### 3. Validation Pipeline
- GPT output validated and sanitized before database writes
- Invalid triplets logged but don't crash ingestion
- Automatic deduplication within extraction batches

### 4. Document Identity
- Text ingestion: User-provided `document_id`
- PDF ingestion: SHA-256 hash ensures uniqueness
- Prevents duplicate ingestion of same document

## Testing the Application

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend/python_worker
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Access the UIs
- **Graph Viewer**: http://localhost:8000/viewer
- **Review Queue**: http://localhost:8000/review-ui
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 3. Ingest a Document
1. Open the Graph Viewer
2. Click "Choose File" and select a PDF
3. Click "Ingest PDF"
4. Wait for processing (status will show progress)
5. Graph will automatically load

### 4. Review Extractions
1. Open the Review Queue
2. See unverified relationships with original context
3. Click "Confirm" for correct extractions
4. Click "Flag as Incorrect" for errors
5. Statistics update in real-time

### 5. Search Across Documents
1. In the Graph Viewer, type a concept name in the search box
2. Press Enter or click "Search"
3. See all relationships for that concept across all documents
4. Toggle "Verified only" to filter by review status

## Next Steps (Pending Tasks)

### Phase 2.1: Enhanced Ingestion Parameters
- Add `max_concepts` and `max_relationships` parameters to extraction prompt
- Allow users to control extraction granularity

### Phase 4.2: Full User Authentication
- Integrate with existing `node-server/users.js` authentication
- Associate all actions with authenticated user_id
- User-specific contribution tracking
- Permission levels (uploader, reviewer, admin)
